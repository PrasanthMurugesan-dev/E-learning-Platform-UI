Description:


The E-Learning Platform is a modern, responsive web application designed to deliver a seamless and interactive online learning experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the platform offers a user-friendly interface that allows learners to browse, explore, and engage with a wide variety of courses across multiple categories. The homepage features an inviting hero section and highlights key benefits such as interactive learning, certification, and flexible study options. The course listing section dynamically displays courses with filtering and search capabilities, enabling users to find content relevant to their interests efficiently. Upon selecting a course, users can view detailed information, stream educational videos, track their progress, take personal notes, and rate the courseâ€”features all persistently managed through local storage to simulate user account functionality. Additionally, the platform supports user authentication via a stylish login and registration interface, along with simulated social login buttons. The design is enriched with professional visual aesthetics including animations, responsive layouts, and hover effects, ensuring a consistent experience across devices. This project demonstrates practical application of front-end development skills and serves as a solid foundation for scalable, real-world educational solutions.
